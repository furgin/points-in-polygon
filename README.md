# points-in-polygon

A node.js library helping you to process and rasterize all points in any given 2D polygon.

## How does it work?

* Triangulation is done with [earcut](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut)
* Triangle sides are determined using [bresenham](https://github.com/madbence/node-bresenham)
* All points in each triangle are iterated and passed to the callback.

## How to install

Install it into your project with
```
npm install --save points-in-polygon
```

## How to use it

```js
const pointsInPolygon = require('points-in-polygon');

let polygon = [
  // first element is defining the outer area of the polygon
  [{x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 10, y: 0}, {x: 10, y: 10}, {x: 0, y: 10}],
  // following elements will define the inner cut out areas
  [{x: 3, y: 3}, {x: 6, y: 3}, {x: 6, y: 6}, {x: 3, y: 6}],
  ...
];
// triangulate, rasterize and calculate points inside the polygon
pointsInPolygon.process(polygon, (x, y) => console.log(x, y));
```
